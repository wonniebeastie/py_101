# What will the following code output?
print([1, 2, 3] + [4, 5])

# Try to answer without running the code.

# MY SOLUTION:
# I think it will output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# SOLUTION:
# Correct. 
# The `+` operator can be used to concatenate two lists.
# This operation merges the second list into the first one, producing
# a new combined list.
