# Back in the stone age (before CSS), we used spaces to align things on the screen. 
# If we have a 40-character wide table of Flintstone family members, 
# how can we center the following title above the table with spaces?

title = "Flintstone Family Members"

# MY SOLUTION
print(title.center(40))
# The `.center()` string method lets you center a string in a given width.

# SOLUTION
# Correct.
