# What do you think the following code will output?

nan_value = float("nan")

print(nan_value == float("nan"))

# Bonus Question
# How can you reliably test if a value is nan?

# MY SOLUTION
# I think it will output `False`.


# SOLUTION

# The output is `False`. `nan` -- not a number -- is a special numeric 
# value that indicates that an operation that was intended to return a
#  number failed. Python doesn't let you use `==` to determine whether
# a value is `nan`.

# To test whether the value is nan, you can use the `math.isnan()`
# function:

import math

nan_value = float("nan")

print(math.isnan(nan_value))
