# Will the code below raise an error?

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[6] = 5

# MY SOLUTION
# Yes, I believe it will raise an error because you're going out of the
# list's range.

# SOLUTION
# Correct.
# It will raise an IndexError when you try to access or modify an 
# element at an index that does not exist.
