munsters_description = "the Munsters are CREEPY and Spooky."
# Turn it into this: => 'The munsters are creepy and spooky.'

print(munsters_description.casefold().capitalize())

# Did not need to method chain as capitalize() method already returns
# the rest of the string in lowercase.

# Lesson: Read documentation better.
